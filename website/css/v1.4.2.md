# Zylo v1.4.2 — Diszi & Zily Update (Pre-Release Website Plan)

**Status:** In Progress (Pre-Commit / Pre-Upload)  
**Purpose:** Align website, branding, and user perception before code deployment

---

## 1. Update Positioning

### Core Message
**Two AI minds. One experience.**

Zylo introduces a dual-personality AI system designed around *intent*, not complexity.

- **Diszi** — analytical, precise, structured
- **Zily** — creative, expressive, conversational

Users can switch instantly without losing context.

## 2. Public In‑Progress Update Page

Create a dedicated page:

```

```

- 🕒 Planned

Example:

- ✔ Diszi analytical formatting
- 🧪 Zily creative tone tuning
- 🛠️ Streaming responses
- 🕒 Collaborative AI mode

Purpose:
- Transparency
- Trust

---

## 3. Visual Identity Direction

### Diszi (Analytical Mode)
- Sharp corners
- Grid-based layouts
- Minimal motion (opacity, subtle translate)
- Technical color palette (cool blues / greys)
- Monospace or system fonts

### Zily (Creative Mode)
- Rounded components
- Floating micro‑animations
- Softer gradients
- Warmer color palette (purples / pinks)
- Looser spacing

**Design Rule:**  
If the screen is blurred, the active AI should still be recognizable.

---

## 4. Model Switching Experience

Switching AI modes should feel *intentional*, not mechanical.

Enhancements:
- Short system transition message
- Header morph animation (200–300ms)
- Optional subtle sound cue (toggleable)

Example messages:
- 🧠 Diszi is taking over…
- ✨ Zily is ready to create.

---

## 5. AI Intent Shortcuts (UX Priority)

Replace “Which model?” thinking with intent-based actions.

### Suggested Shortcut Buttons
- Analyze
- Debug
- Explain
- Compare
- Brainstorm
- Rewrite
- Create

Routing logic:
- Analytical intents → Diszi
- Creative intents → Zily

Result:
- Faster onboarding
- Lower cognitive load

This establishes Zylo’s identity clearly and confidently.
